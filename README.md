Our .NET Core backend service project aims to develop a robust and scalable RESTful backend service using .NET Core (C#). Key features include integration with SQL/SQL Server databases for efficient data management, JWT token-based authentication, and user role management using Identity Framework. Emphasis is placed on code organization, readability, and maintainability, with GitHub for version control and Microsoft Azure for deployment. Our project represents a commitment to excellence in software engineering, striving to deliver a solution that exceeds expectations and sets new standards in web development.
# .NET Core Backend Service Project README

Welcome to our .NET Core (C#) RESTful backend service project! This README provides an overview of the project, its features, requirements, and guidelines.

## Project Description
Our project focuses on building a robust .NET Core backend service with the following features:

- Utilization of SQL/SQL Server database with at least 5 tables and foreign key relationships.
- Implementation of JWT token for secure user authentication.
- Integration of Identity Framework for user management, roles, and access control.
- Email service triggered upon user sign-up.
- Version control using GitHub repository.
- Deployment on Microsoft Azure for accessibility and scalability.

## Project Requirements
To meet the project's objectives, we'll ensure the following requirements are fulfilled:

- RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on relevant entities.
- User authentication using Identity Framework.
- Configuration of user roles (Admin, User) with distinct access permissions.
- Use of JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.
- Integration of an email service for user sign-up confirmation.
- Proper error handling and validation.
- Dependency Injection for efficient code organization.
- Logging implementation for tracking application events.

## Updated Code Organization
### Models and Controllers
- Models: All database models reside in the "Models" namespace/folder.
- Controllers: Organized within the "Controllers" namespace/folder.
- Authentication: Encapsulated within dedicated models and controllers.

## Updated Authentication and Authorization
### Identity Framework Implementation
- User authentication handled via Identity Framework.
- Role definition and permission assignment centralized.

### JWT Implementation
- JWT token logic encapsulated within specific models and controllers.

## Database Schema
- Well-structured relational database with organized model representations.

## Updated Project Presentation
During the presentation, we'll emphasize:
- Distinct organization into models and controllers.
- Benefits of clean separation of concerns for maintainability.

## Additional Tips
- Utilize folders/namespaces for code organization.
- Prioritize code readability for better collaboration.
- Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle for class/module design.
- Ensure API responses are in JSON format for easy consumption with Postman.
- Attendance at presentations is mandatory for project submission.

## Conclusion
This README provides a comprehensive guide to our .NET Core backend service project. Let's adhere to these guidelines and work collaboratively to achieve project success. For any queries or assistance, feel free to reach out to the team.
