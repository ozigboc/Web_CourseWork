**.NET Core Backend Service Project README**

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the .NET Core Backend Service project README. This project aims to develop a robust and scalable RESTful backend service using .NET Core (C#). It integrates various technologies to achieve efficient data management, secure authentication, user role management, and seamless deployment. This README serves as a guide to understand the project's objectives, features, requirements, and technology stack.

**Project Description:**

The project focuses on building a feature-rich .NET Core backend service with the following key features:

**Database Management:**

Utilizes SQLite Server database with well-defined schemas and foreign key relationships.
Authentication and Authorization: Implements JWT token-based authentication for secure user authentication and integrates Identity Framework for user role management and access control.
Email Service Integration: Includes an email service triggered upon user sign-up for confirmation and communication purposes.
Version Control and Deployment: Utilizes GitHub for version control and Microsoft Azure for seamless deployment, ensuring accessibility and scalability.

**Technology Stack**
The project leverages the following technologies:

.NET Core: The framework for building cross-platform applications, providing high performance and scalability.
C#: The primary programming language used for backend development, offering strong typing and object-oriented programming features.
SQLite Server: A lightweight, file-based database management system for efficient data storage and management.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A compact and self-contained way to transmit information securely between parties, used for authentication purposes.
Identity Framework: A set of libraries for implementing user authentication, authorization, and role-based access control in .NET applications.
GitHub: A widely used platform for version control and collaboration, facilitating seamless code management and team collaboration.
Microsoft Azure: A cloud computing service for deploying, managing, and scaling applications, ensuring high availability and reliability.

**Project Requirements**
To fulfill the project's objectives, the following requirements are met:

RESTful APIs: Provides endpoints for CRUD operations on relevant entities, ensuring seamless interaction with the backend service.
User Authentication and Authorization: Implements user authentication using Identity Framework and defines user roles with distinct access permissions.
JWT Token Integration: Utilizes JWT tokens for secure authentication and authorization of user requests.
Email Service: Integrates an email service for user sign-up confirmation and communication.
Error Handling and Validation: Ensures proper error handling and validation of user inputs to maintain data integrity and application security.
Dependency Injection: Utilizes dependency injection for efficient code organization and modular development.
Logging Implementation: Implements logging functionality to track application events and debug issues effectively.

**Code Organization:**

The codebase follows a structured organization:
Models: Contains database models representing entities and their relationships.
Controllers: Houses controllers responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and generating appropriate responses.
Authentication: Encapsulates authentication-related logic within dedicated models and controllers.
